This is a program that I did not finish but it is still somewhat cool just to watch. It's purpuse it to see how many teams of different colors react when put in a map with bonuses like attack or defense.<br><br>
First you have to set the width and height of the rectangles representing each dot on the screen at horizontal and vertical fields and then click at the "Atualizar"(update) button.<br><br>
Second you can click at the "Gerar"(generate) button to randomly paint each square at the screen with one color. You may notice some stable green and blue dots, they represent the attack and defense bonuses for each team.<br><br>
Another button is the "Gerar separado"(generate separated) button. It generates the bonuses squares and one random starting point for every team/color.<br><br>
The "Tempo(ms)"(Time) button represents the rate that the screen will update<br><br>
The "NÂ° vezes"(Number of times) represent the number of times the program will simulate the "game".<br><br>
At the "Escolher cor"(choose color) part you can click in one color filled square and then paint the left screen as a Paint program that I did not finish its use but it is functional. You must click the "Ativar/Desativar"(Activate/Deactivate) button in order to it paint.<br><br>
Finally the "Simular"(Simulate) button is the one that you click to properly start the simulation and watch.
